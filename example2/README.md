## Customization

### Changing Game Speed
Modify the `gameSpeed` property in the `SnakeGame` constructor:
```javascript
this.gameSpeed = 150; // Lower = faster
```

### Changing Grid Size
Modify the `gridSize` property:
```javascript
this.gridSize = 20; // Pixels per grid cell
```

### Changing Colors
Update the color values in `drawGame()` method:
```javascript
// Snake head color
this.ctx.fillStyle = '#2c5282';
// Snake body color  
this.ctx.fillStyle = '#3182ce';
// Food color
this.ctx.fillStyle = '#e53e3e';
```

### Boundary Behavior
The game currently uses boundary wrapping. To change to wall collision:
```javascript
// In the update() method, replace boundary wrapping with:
if (newHead.x < 0 || newHead.x >= this.tileCount || 
    newHead.y < 0 || newHead.y >= this.tileCount) {
    this.gameOver();
    return;
}
```
